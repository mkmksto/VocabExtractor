# VocabExtractor

Simple plugin used to extract the highlighted vocabulary from a sentence field, deconjugate it through `jisho.org`'s public API, then send that information back into the Anki field for the vocabulary.
This was built primarily for use with premade Anki decks where I usually watch the source material first without doing sentence mining while watching the material (to avoid distractions), then I simply use an already existing Anki deck for the same material, highlighting only the words that I don't know yet and extracting them to their own fields.
